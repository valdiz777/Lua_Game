How to use maze algorithm
=============================
This is an implementation of the recursive backtracker maze generation algorithm found at Think Labyrinth! but without recursion :)
This solution consists of four files:
stack.lua - very simple implementation of the LIFO container, used for stacking the travel path
maze.lua - simple maze implementation
backtracker.lua - actual algorithm implementation
demo.lua - some code to show off the functionality
